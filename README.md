# 😊Predict the Introverts from the Extroverts (Kaggle Playground Series Season 5, Episode 7)

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual is an introvert or an extrovert based on behavioral features. 
The project uses the Kaggle Playground Series – Season 5 Episode 7 dataset.

## Problem Description
The goal is to classify individuals into two personality types:
- **Introvert**
- **Extrovert**

Using the provided tabular dataset, the project explores:
- Data understanding through EDA  
- Feature engineering  
- Model comparison  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Ensemble methods  
- Final prediction
